A small JavaScript game we made at Cal Hacks!

This game is essentially a mix of pong and tetris - two users play pong with tetris blocks. Each user can "shoot" blocks out of his or her paddle and rotate them with the key commands. Additionally, once the blocks reach the other side, they stick to the wall and other stationary blocks. When the blocks extend beyond the user's paddle, that user loses.

It sounds confusing, but play the game!
